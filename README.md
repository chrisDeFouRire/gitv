# Gitv

Gitv is a CLI tool for easy SemVer versioning of your tags.

## TODO

* [ ] Allow setting an annotated version tag with a comment
* [X] Generalize the patch command to minor and major ie. bumpWithBumper
* [ ] Rename to git-semver to integrate as a git plugin
* [ ] Force flag instead of quiet
